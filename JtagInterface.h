/**
	@brief Abstract representation of a JTAG adapter.

	A JTAG adapter provides access to a single scan chain containing zero or more JtagDevice objects.

	The JtagInterface class provides three levels of abstraction for scan chain access.

	### Low level (bit level)

	This is the most basic way to access a JTAG adapter - clocking raw bits in and out.

	In order to support a new "dumb" JTAG adapter without any higher level protocol offload, create a new derived class
	and implement each of the following functions:

	\li GetName()
	\li GetSerial()
	\li GetUserID()
	\li GetFrequency()
	\li ShiftData()
	\li ShiftTMS()
	\li SendDummyClocks()

	The low-level interface also includes support for pipelined / queued command execution. This can improve
	performance when using adapters connected to high-latency links such as USB.

	The default implementations simply call the non-deferred versions and execute immediately. If an adapter supports
	queueing of commands, overriding these functions can result in higher performance.

	\li IsSplitScanSupported()
	\li SendDummyClocksDeferred()
	\li ShiftDataWriteOnly()
	\li ShiftDataReadOnly()
	\li Commit()

	### Mid level (state level)

	By default, these functions are simple wrappers around ShiftTMS() for changing between chain states.

	If the adapter supports server-side management of chain state, these can be overridden to simply push a command
	to the adapter.

	\li ResetToIdle()
	\li TestLogicReset()
	\li EnterShiftIR()
	\li LeaveExit1IR()
	\li EnterShiftDR()
	\li LeaveExit1DR()

	### High level (register level)

	These functions provide access to individual registers of TAPs, providing padding as necessary.

	By default these functions are simple wrappers around ShiftData() and the mid-level state functions.

	If the adapter supports server-side padding insertion/removal, these can be overridden to reduce overhead.

	The "deferred" versions of these functions may queue commands. To ensure that all previous queued commands have
	executed, call Commit() or any function which returns readback data from a scan transaction.

	\li SetIR()
	\li SetIRDeferred()
	\li ScanDR()
	\li ScanDRDeferred()
	\li ScanDRSplitRead()
	\li ScanDRSplitWrite()

	### Device management

	These functions provide access to individual devices on the chain.

	\li InitializeChain()
	\li GetDeviceCount()
	\li GetIDCode()
	\li GetDevice()
	\li SwapOutDummy()

	### Performance profiling

	These functions return stats on the amount of data shifted and the time spent waiting for the adapter.

	These may be useful to compare different programming algorithms and optimizations to reduce unnecessary activity.

	\li GetShiftOpCount()
	\li GetRecoverableErrorCount()
	\li GetDataBitCount()
	\li GetModeBitCount()
	\li GetDummyClockCount()
	\li GetShiftTime()

	### NOTES

	Devices are numbered such that TDI goes to device N and TDO goes to device 0.

		operation only; the read is buffered in the JTAG adapter and no readback is performed until ShiftDataReadOnly()
		is called. This allows several shift operations to occur in sequence without incurring a USB turnaround delay
		or other driver latency overhead for each shift operation.

		If split scanning is not supported this call is equivalent to ShiftData() and ShiftDataReadOnly() is a no-op.

		This function MUST be followed by either another ShiftDataWriteOnly() call, a ShiftTMS() call, or a
		ShiftDataReadOnly() call. There must be exactly one ShiftDataReadOnly() call for each ShiftDataWriteOnly()
		call and they must be in order with the same rcv_data and count values. The result of doing otherwise is
